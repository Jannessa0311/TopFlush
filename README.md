# TopFlush

TopFlush is a cutting-edge web application designed to revolutionize the way people find and review public restrooms. Integrated with Google Maps API, the platform allows users to mark restrooms on a map and provide comprehensive reviews based on cleanliness, ease of location, and sufficiency of facilities. Users can also upload images to accompany their reviews, offering a visual guide to potential visitors. To ensure the most accurate and up-to-date information, restrooms that are reported as no longer available by a certain number of users are automatically removed from the map. Additional features include the ability to sort restrooms based on reviews or distance from the user, making it easier than ever to find the best restroom options nearby.
